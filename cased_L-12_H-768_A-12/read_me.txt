In this folder, I downloaded the pretrained bert model that is published by Google. It is available here: https://github.com/google-research/bert
It is too big to be uploaded onto Git hub. Therefore I uploaded onto Google Drive.

Instructions:
1. go to https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1QYoO4Ot3C0tcdqGzEJH2m8qJMuHAxTP3 and download bert_model.ckpt.data file into this folder
